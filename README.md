This is a scan of the Original Douay-Rheims Bible circa 1600.  I got
these from
http://www.fatimamovement.com/images/eBooks/original-douay-rheims-catholic-bible
and then extracted the individual page images from that. I am using
this version as the primary source for my project to create a newly
typeset edition of the Douay-Rheims Bible.
